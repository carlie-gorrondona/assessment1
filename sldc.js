/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.

//Planning
//Analysis of Requirements
//Design
//Implementation
//Testing & Integration
//Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.
